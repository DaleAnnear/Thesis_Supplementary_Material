This repository contains the supplementary data tables of the four experimental chapters within the PhD thesis entitled "CGG Short Tandem Repeats in Unexplained Intellectual Disability and Autism".


Chapter 3 - Abundancy of Polymorphic CGG Repeats in the Human Genome Suggests a Broad Involvement in Neurological Disease

Supplementary Table S3.1:	Summary of all CGG repeat loci detected by ExpansionHunter and their corresponding attributes (n=6101).

Supplementary Table S3.2:	Median repeat lengths observed among all polymorphic CGG repeat loci (n=5673) and the corresponding number of repeat loci that displayed each median repeat length.

Supplementary Table S3.3: 	Genes of interest. Genes associated with ID, AD, and CGG repeats with their corresponding haploinsufficiency index, pLI score and cohort polymorphism rate (n=410).

Supplementary Table S3.4:	List of genes used genes used for routine screening for ID and related NDD (n=1295).


Chapter 4 - Non-Mendelian Inheritance Patterns and Extreme Deviation Rates of CGG Repeats in Autism

Supplementary Table S4.1:	 Genetic regions and CGG STR loci predicted as being significantly represented in the autism-affected probands.

Supplementary Table S4.2:	Genetic regions and CGG STR loci displaying being a tentatively increased associated in the autism-affected probands.

Supplementary Table S4.3:	Genetic regions and genes retaining significance and tentative tentatively increased association in the autism-affected probands after stringent multiple test correction.


Chapter 5 - CGG Short Tandem Repeat Expansions are Overrepresented in Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Supplementary Table S5.1		All large CGG STR expansions (n=154) detected among the MSSNG trios (n=1925) along with the entire trio genotype for the CGG repeat locus of interest where the repeat expansion was detected.

Supplementary Table S5.2:		All large CGG STR expansions (n=419) detected among the NIHR BioResource and MSSNG patient cohorts (n=12,146).

Supplementary Table S5.3:		Gene intersections and adjusted p-values across the different databases utilised for the CGG STR expansion-bearing gene enrichment analyses.

Supplementary Table S5.4:	Clustering data used to construct protein-protein interaction network of the 118 CGG expansion genes.


Chapter 6 - CGG, CAG, and GAA: Genome-Wide Comparison of the Disease Linked Trinucleotide Short Tandem Repeats

Supplementary Table S6.1:		The full GRCh38 catalogue of characteristics for the CGG, CAG, and GAA short tandem repeat loci interrogated through ExpansionHunter.

Supplementary Table S6.2:	Two-way ANOVA results comparing the three different trinucleotide STR classes by polymorphism rate and repeat length.

Supplementary Table S6.3:		Statistical comparison of the effect that STR motif and the genetic region have on repeat length.

Supplementary Table S6.4:		Statistical comparison of the effect that STR motif and the genetic region have on repeat polymorphism.
