MCL	19	Pink	2	KIAA1147	9606.ENSP00000445768	Denn domain containing 11; Protein LCHN; May play a role in neuritogenesis, as well as in neuronal recovery and/or restructuring in the hippocampus following transient cerebral ischemia
MCL	19	Pink	2	SV2C	9606.ENSP00000423541	Mfs transporter, vnt family, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2; Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C; Plays a role in the control of regulated secretion in neural and endocrine cells, enhancing selectively low-frequency neurotransmission. Positively regulates vesicle fusion by maintaining the readily releasable pool of secretory vesicles (By similarity)
